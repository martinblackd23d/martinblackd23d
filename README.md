My mission is to be on the cutting edge of technological innovation to improve as many lives as I possibly can

Leadership:
I always aspired to be a leader, but I never felt quite ready to take the initiative. Then suddenly I was put in charge of a 10-person team and I realized I was never going to feel ready. Fortunately, I have a great team around me who enable me to try and become the best leader I can be.

Software development:
I've started coding when I was 13 and I never stopped. Along the way I explored many areas, including cybersecurity, full-stack development, data analysis, or even simple scripts to improve my everyday productivity. But the common theme that keeps me going is just the sheer fun in problem solving.

Community:
When people come to me to ask for advice, they usually think I have the answer. In reality, they often just need guidance to find it themselves. My role as a leader and community member is simply to be the anchor point they can use to explore.


At Seeds of Success, I lead a team of 10 software developers with the goal of creating an AI-powered assistant that connects students to the resources they could benefit from the most.

At Saint Paul College as a data analyst intern, I worked on various projects to improve efficiency of other departments, which also enabled me to learn from people in many different disciplines to best serve their needs.

At Saint Paul College, I also played a key role in the community. I was the one person who had the perspective of a young student, as well as the insight and knowledge of a trained staff member. This enabled me to efficiently help people directly or guide them to the necessary resources.

At Cross Cultural Connections Sojourn I help organizing various multicultural events, where I just enjoy the different set of problems event planning poses as opposed to software development.
