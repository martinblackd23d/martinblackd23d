Looking for a software engineer internship

I am a computer science student looking to become a software engineer.
I have an interest in many areas of computer science. Over the years, I learned about and did projects in these areas:
machine learning and data science; game theory with a focus on AI; cybersecurity, network and web penetration testing; computer graphics with Blender; game development and design theory, some practical learning with Unreal Engine 4/5; Music production with FL Studio.  
I'm also learning web development and desktop development, both to develop skills a company would need and to be able to make scripts, projects and websites I can use myself.

Goal: becoming a software engineer and eventually working on the most innovative technologies at the most innovative companies

Experience: I have been coding and building projects on my own for a few years now, trying to explore many areas of computer science, and building a solid foundation in each, so I can handle whatever project or job I need to do.  
I am also a really fast learner and have a very solid background in math and physics with many good results at science competitions.

Interests:  
-Machine learning and AI  
-Data science  
-Computer graphics  
-Audio processing  
-Full-stack development  
-Web development  
-Cybersecurity  
etc.

Hobbies:  
3D modeling and animation with Blender and Unreal Engine 4/5  
Music production with FL Studio  
Video games (both playing and development/design)
