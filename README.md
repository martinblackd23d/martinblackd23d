Looking for a software engineer internship

I am a computer science student looking to become a software engineer.
I have an interest in many areas of computer science. Over the years, I learned about and did projects in these areas:
machine learning and data science; game theory with a focus on AI; cybersecurity, network and web penetration testing; computer graphics with Blender; game development and design theory, some practical learning with Unreal Engine 4/5; Music production with FL Studio.
I'm also learning web development and desktop development, both to develop skills a company would need and to be able to make scripts, projects and websites I can use myself.
My greatest strengths are being a really fast learner, and having a very solid background in math and physics.
